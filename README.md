# AC221-FinalProject

## How this repository is organized
* `eda_miru.ipynb`: main notebook with data EDA & analysis

* `data` directory: all data used for analysis in our project
  * `age.csv`, `gender.csv`, `marital.csv`: demographic statistics on Taiwan population
  * `data.csv`, `data.xls`: actual dataset used for credit default predictions

* `docs` directory: files for the writeup website

* `prior_research`: papers referenced or used as background research
